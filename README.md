I'm actively searching for a job as a software developer and am dedicating all my spare time to developing this application. When finished, this application will have the following features:

Create an account and add pictures.
Like other users' profiles.
Match if both users like each other.
Chat with other users.
Before enabling chat, users must have a 'get to know each other' call.

The backend is currently hosted on Google's Firebase, but I plan to switch to AWS later on so that I can code the backend using cloud development kits.

Android support only.

To start this application:
1. cd frontend
2. flutter run
